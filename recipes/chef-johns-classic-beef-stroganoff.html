      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 lbs beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2 inch strips</li>
      <li>salt $ pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, sliced or diced</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth, divided</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sour cream / creme fraiche</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh chopped chives</li>
      <li>salt, pepper & Worcestershire sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season beef generously with salt & pepper</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in
        beef and cook stirring constantly, for 6-7 minutes, until liquid
        evaporates and meat browns. Remove meat from pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir butter, mushrooms and onions into pan; cook and stir over medium
        heat until lightly browned. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in
        flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deglaze the pan with wine and 1 cup of stock, scraping the bottom of the
        pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer, cook for 3-4
        minutes, until the sauce thickens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of stock; bring to a
        simmer and transfer to the slow-cooker set on low and cook 2-3 hours
        with the lid on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in sour cream/creme fraiche. Stir in chives. Season with
        Worcestershire, salt and pepper to taste.
